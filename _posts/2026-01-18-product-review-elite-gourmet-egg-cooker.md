I used to think that boiling an egg is the only way to cook a hard-boiled egg. However, I learned there is a much more gentle way to hard-boil an egg. And that is through steaming! Similar to my steamed salmon recipe, steaming is much more gentle on the egg. When you boil an egg in water, you have the potential for the egg to bounce around in the violent, boiling water and crack, leading to a messy egg where the egg white starts seeping out of the shell. Still edible of course, but not as pleasant to eat.

### The Steaming Device

I have not to make steamed hard-boiled eggs on the stovetop. However, I recently got an electric egg steaming device, which is far more convenient than having to watch the stovetop fire. This is by no means a sponsored post, I just happen to use and like this brand -- Elite Gourmet.

Here's the model number if you want to get the same one:

The full list of their products can be found on their website at [https://shopelitegourmet.com/collections/egg-cookers](https://shopelitegourmet.com/collections/egg-cookers).

### The Steaming Process

Along with this steaming device, the box comes with a handy water measuring cup that has different water levels for hard-boiled, medium-boiled, and soft-boiled. I currently stick with a level halfway between hard-boiled and medium-boiled. Any lower and the yolk gets a little too runny for me.

I simply place the eggs in the convenient egg holder slot and add the water:

Place the lid on, and press the power button:

After a few minutes, the steaming device will automatically turn off and I'll remove the lid and take the eggs out to cool down for a few minutes. Remove the shell and enjoy!
