I used to think that boiling was the only way to cook a hard-boiled egg. However, I recently learned that there is a much more gentle method: steaming! Similar to my steamed salmon recipe, steaming is gentle on the egg. When you boil an egg in water, it has the potential to bounce around in the violent, boiling water and crack, leading to a mess where the egg white seeps out of the shell. It's still edible, of course, but not nearly as pleasant to eat.

### The Steaming Device

I have yet to try making steamed eggs on the stovetop. Instead, I recently picked up an electric egg steaming device, which is far more convenient than having to monitor the stove. This is by no means a sponsored post; I just happen to use and like this brand—Elite Gourmet.

Here's the model number if you want to get the same one:

The full list of their products can be found on their website at [https://shopelitegourmet.com/collections/egg-cookers](https://shopelitegourmet.com/collections/egg-cookers).

### The Steaming Process

Along with the steaming device, the box comes with a handy water measuring cup marked for hard, medium, and soft-boiled eggs. I currently stick with a level halfway between hard and medium; any lower and the yolk stays a little too runny for my taste.

I simply place the eggs in the convenient egg holder slots and add the water:

Place the lid on, and press the power button:

After a few minutes, the steaming device automatically turns off. I remove the lid and let the eggs cool down for a few minutes before peeling. Lastly, remove the shell and enjoy!
