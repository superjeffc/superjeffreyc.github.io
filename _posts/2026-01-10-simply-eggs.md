When I think about using eggs to cook, my goto is a stir fry dish, like fried rice or singapore rice noodles. Growing up, my dad would always make me an egg and bacon sandwich before school. The common theme in my kitchen has always been eggs as a supporting actor—never the star. My mindset was that eggs were too boring to be the main actor on a plate. Do eggs really have what it takes to be front and center? How can I make eggs the star of the dish?

### The Simple Answer

Hard boiled eggs!

What other way to make the egg the star of the dish than with simply eggs? This dish lets you truly appreciate the egg and its unique flavor profile.

### The Experiment

I want to try to taste the egg in its simplest form. No extra ingredients, no extra seasoning. A simple hard-boiled egg.

I've come across many hard boiled eggs on various occasions, but most of them were hard-boiled with seasoned water or seasoned after being de-shelled. The thought of a hard boiled egg without any seasoning or any other extra ingredients seemed boring to me. I didn't believe that a hard-boiled egg could stand up on its own. However, I wanted to see if I could taste the true flavor of an egg.

### The Verdict

Without any other ingredients or seasoning, the egg is the star of the show, and I have been underappreciating it for awhile.

#### The Profile

The egg whites are tender without the rubbery texture. The egg yolk has a slight gummy texture (with a light bite to it, but not runny) and has a very rich and creamy taste to it.

#### The Discovery

Hard boiled eggs are not boring. In fact, there is so much joy when eating an egg -- the texture change between the egg whites and yolk, the creaminess of the egg yolk, and I can also taste a hint of salty flavor, with no seasoning added!

#### Would I eat it again?

Every morning! Eggs are a great source of protein and other nutrients to start your day.

### The Challenge

Try a hard boiled egg and notice the different textures and flavor profiles as you eat it.
